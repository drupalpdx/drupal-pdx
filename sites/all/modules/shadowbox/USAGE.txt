USAGE
=====

The module is integrated with filefield's image element so you can select from
a number of different options for displaying images uploaded to nodes and shown
in views. You need to have an imagecache preset to see display options for
fields in nodes and views.

If you need to integrate Shadowbox with some other Drupal module it is quite
likely that you can do it on the theme layer. For instructions on manually
crafting links, please see the official usage guide:
